                  <h2>The Journey</h2>
                  <h3>120 minutes &nbsp;&nbsp;$150</h3>
                  <p>Rooted in ancient India's loving respect and care for the body, this offering is balancing, beautifying, nurturing and awakening. The Journey begins with Garshana, a gentle exfoliation that prepares the body for Abhyangha, which is a rhythmic, warm oil aromatherapy massage that quiets your nervous system and gently loosens toxins. Soothing hot towels coax the oils deeper into tissues. The journey concludes with Vishesh, encompassing slow, deep strokes that deeply penetrate your muscles. Experience the bliss of the Journey into three levels of increasingly deeper healing.</p>

                  <h2>Abhyanga Massage</h2>
                  <h3>60 minutes &nbsp;&nbsp;$95</h3>
                  <p>Traditional Indian full body hot oil massage. Heated herbalized oils, specific to your Dosha type, are applied in a meditatively rhythmic, vigorous pattern. The medicinal oils are then penetrated into your blood stream further with the application of steaming hot towels. Abhyanga pacifies the central nervous system and is detoxifying to your entire system. Great to boost your immunity and for a cleanse as you transition into new seasons.</p>

                  <h2>Marma Massage</h2>
                  <h3>60 minutes &nbsp;&nbsp;$80</h3>
                  <p>A marma point is a juncture on the body where two or more types of tissue meet (such as muscles, veins, ligaments, bones, joints). There are 107 of these marma points on our body and each is an energy center that coordinates consciousness between mind and body. Gentle stimulation of Marma points, for your specific dosha type, promotes physical and mental rehabilitation by clearing away obstructions between the muscles, nerves and brain. As in Acupuncture, these points also correspond to internal organs and systems of the body, which respond to manual stimulation. Marma massage is deeply relaxing and cleansing, with long lasting rejuvenation effects.</p>

You will experience the ultimate balancing and opening treatment that will bring enhanced clarity and cleansing to your well being.</p>

                  <blockquote>I met Collaine back when she was thinking about becoming a massage therapist.  I knew right away that she had a very kind soul and had the personality to make a good therapist. I've received a lot of massages during my lifetime, am a massage therapist myself, and am very picky so was a little skeptical about getting a massage from someone just out of school.  I was blown away!  She gave me one of the best massages I have ever had.  Since then, I have continued to receive massages from Collaine on a regular basis and have never been disappointed.</blockquote>
